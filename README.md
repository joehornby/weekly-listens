# Weekly Listens

A script to fetch the top played artists from Last.fm and write them to a Gist, like this:

```text
Martin Luke Brown            –––|––––––––    23 plays
Mk.gee                       ––|–––––––––    17 plays
Genevieve Artadi *           ––|–––––––––    14 plays
Low Roar                     –|––––––––––    10 plays
Nilüfer Yanya                –|––––––––––     9 plays

* = new this week
```

## Setup

I'm using Bun for this project.

```bash
bun install
```

## Usage

```bash
bun run start
```

## Development

```bash
bun run dev
```

## Testing

I'm using Bun's built-in test runner for this project. The API is similar to Jest or Vitest if you'd prefer to install those and use them instead.

```bash
bun test
```
